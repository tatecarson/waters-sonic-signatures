# Water's Sonic Signatures

Computational Sound Studies and Ecological Awareness in Tarkovsky's Films 

**Tate Carson** | **Assistant Professor of Sound Design** | **Dakota State University**

<!--
When we watch the films of Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, water isn't just a background element—it speaks to us through both sound and image, creating what I believe is a profound ecological awareness. In my research, I've combined computational methods with qualitative analysis to explore how the sounds of water in Solaris, Stalker, and Nostalghia contribute to this environmental consciousness.

## Why Water and Tarkovsky?

In his book Sculpting in Time, Tarkovsky offers us a fascinating glimpse into his thinking about natural elements like water. He reflects on rain, saying it's not just symbolic weather but part of 'the truth of our lives.' What strikes me about his perspective is how he seems almost defensive when people search for hidden meanings in his natural imagery. He tells us quite directly: 'I am puzzled when I am told that people cannot simply enjoy watching nature.' For him, these elements create an 'aesthetic setting' rather than functioning as symbols—something he rejects with a passionate 'Heaven forbid!'

# Motivation & Research Question

- This project explores how water sounds in Tarkovsky’s *Solaris*, *Stalker*, and *Nostalghia* operate as more than atmospheric effects or mere symbols.

> *How do these sonic treatments of water contribute to ecological awareness?*

<!-- 
So what got me interested in this project? About a year ago, I watched Stalker for the first time, and honestly, it affected me like no film had before. There was something about Tarkovsky's cinematic language—particularly how he portrays nature—that felt completely unique yet somehow deeply familiar.

What captivated me wasn't just the visual imagery of natural elements, but how they seem to exist as actual experiences his characters encounter. When I saw this conference's theme, the connection clicked immediately. Water is everywhere in Tarkovsky's films, especially in these three works I've chosen to analyze.

What I'm trying to understand is how Tarkovsky uses water not just visually but sonically. I'm combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to explore whether the sound design might actually enhance our ecological awareness when we experience his films.

# Cinema as Ecological World-Making

:: content ::

- Cinema creates worlds that are not separate from reality, but continuous with it <Cite bref="adrianj.ivakhivEcologiesMovingImage2013"/>.
- Films can reshape how we perceive social and ecological relations.
- Through spectacle, narrative, and meaning, cinema draws us into relational ecologies — where perception and world are intertwined.
- Some films, like Tarkovsky’s, foster ecological awareness by revealing the world’s materiality, vitality, and openness to becoming.
- Audiovisual ecology suggests that sound and image together shape ecological perception [@jordanSchizophonicImaginationAudiovisual].

<!-- 
Before explaining the quantitative basis for this presentation, let me frame the theoretical foundation for my analysis. Adrian Ivakhiv's work has been essential—he argues that cinema doesn't create worlds separate from reality, but continuous with it. Films actively reshape how we perceive both social and ecological relationships around us.

Cinema uses spectacle, narrative, and meaning to draw us into what I'd call relational ecologies—these spaces where our perception and the world become deeply intertwined.

Tarkovsky's films exemplify this perfectly. They foster ecological awareness by making visible the world's materiality and vitality. And this is where sound becomes so critical—as Randolph Jordan's concept of audiovisual ecology suggests, it's not just the images but the sounds working together that shape our ecological perception. In Tarkovsky's case, those water sounds aren't just background—they're actively creating our experience of his cinematic world.

# Materializing Sound Indices (MSIs) 

:: content ::

- **MSIs** are sonic details that make us *feel* the physical, material qualities of a sound source [@Chion_Gorbman_2018].
- Sounds rich in MSIs make scenes feel tangible and grounded.
- Sparse MSIs make sounds feel ethereal or abstract.
- Water in Tarkovsky's films often acts as a high-MSI material, immersing viewers in a concrete, ecological reality.

<!-- 
Now let's explore a key concept from film sound theory that's particularly relevant to Tarkovsky's work. Michel Chion introduces the concept of Materializing Sound Indices, or MSIs—those sonic details that make us physically feel the material qualities of what we're hearing.

Sounds rich in MSIs can make scenes feel tangible and grounded in physical reality, when MSIs are sparse, sounds take on a more ethereal or abstract quality.

In Tarkovsky's films, water frequently functions as this high-MSI material. Some examples are detailed acoustic texture of dripping water or the resonance of splashing—these sounds immerse viewers in a concrete, ecological reality by constantly pulling us back to the 'here-and-now' of the physical world.

<!-- 
I'll now describe some acoustic measures that help us understand how water sounds might affect viewers. This table shows four key indices from ecoacoustics research.

When we look at Acoustic Evenness or AEI, we're measuring how balanced the energy is across the frequency spectrum—think of sounds like gentle rain or surf, which tend to feel calm and pleasant to listeners.

Acoustic Richness combines loudness with variation—it's typically high in complex urban soundscapes mixing traffic and machinery, which most people perceive as busy or stressful.

Median Amplitude tells us about the relationship between overall loudness and quiet moments. When this value is high, like in a constant background hum, listeners often experience it as chaotic or annoying.

Finally, Number of Peaks counts those sudden transients across frequency bands—things like water drips, insect sounds, or bird calls. These detailed, transient sounds typically register as lively and natural to our perception.

These indices give us concrete ways to analyze how Tarkovsky's water sounds might be shaping our ecological awareness.

# Ecoacoustics in Film Sound Studies

:: content ::

- Applying ecoacoustic indices to film soundtracks could:
  - Reveal sonic environments that cultivate ecological awareness.
  - Differentiate scenes dominated by natural vs. anthropogenic sounds.
  - Analyze how soundscapes influence viewer emotion, attention, and sense of place.
- A step toward computational ecocinema analysis.

<!-- 
What I'm exploring is a novel methodological bridge between two fields that don't typically talk to each other. By applying these ecoacoustic indices to film soundtracks, we can start to quantify something that's usually discussed only qualitatively.

This approach could reveal which sonic environments might cultivate ecological awareness in viewers. It gives us more ways to differentiate scenes dominated by natural elements versus those filled with human-made sounds.

Beyond just identifying what's in the soundtrack, these indices help us analyze how these soundscapes influence viewers' emotions, where they direct their attention, and how they develop a sense of place within the film.

I see this as an important step toward what we might call computational ecocinema analysis—bringing quantitative methods to questions that have largely been explored through critical theory alone.

# Films & Method

- **Studied**: *Solaris* (1972), *Stalker* (1979), *Nostalghia* (1983)  
- **Approach**: Scene-by-scene tagging of water events  


<!-- 
For this study, I'm focusing on three of Tarkovsky's most water-rich films—Solaris from 1972, Stalker from 1979, and Nostalghia from 1983. Together, these works span a significant portion of his filmography and showcase his evolving relationship with water as both a visual and sonic element.

My methodological approach involves going through each film scene by scene and meticulously tagging every moment where water appears as a significant sonic event (including when we see water, but don't hear it). This allows me to build a comprehensive catalog of how water sounds function across these works.

What's particularly interesting about these three films is how they represent different facets of Tarkovsky's water exploration—from the vast, mysterious ocean-planet in Solaris to the puddles and rain-drenched landscapes of Stalker and finally to the ritualistic water imagery in Nostalghia with its famous candle-carrying scene.

<!-- 
In this chart we can see quantitative evidence of how Tarkovsky employs different water types across Solaris, Stalker, and Nostalghia. We can see how each film develops its own distinctive water signature. Stalker overwhelmingly features pond stillness, or bodies of still soundless water, and splashing scenes.

Solaris, on the other hand, shows a pronounced emphasis on submersion scenes - of the ocean of Solaris. We don't dive into the ocean, but immerse in it psychologically. We literally and figuratively enter the underwater consciousness of the characters.

With Nostalghia, we see a more distributed pattern across water types, particularly flowing water, gurgling sounds, and rain sequences. This diverse water soundscape reflects the film's themes of displacement and emotional fluidity.

What's particularly valuable about this quantitative analysis is that it shows us not just the presence of water, but the specific frequency of different water scenes across these works - revealing how Tarkovsky's sonic strategies evolved throughout his filmography.

<img src="/figures/rain_calmness_heatmap.svg" style="max-height: 500px;">

<!--
This heatmap shows a 'calmness' ranking of Tarkovsky's rain scenes using ecoacoustic analysis. The formula we're using weighs perceptually positive elements like Number of Peaks and Acoustic Evenness against negative factors like Median Amplitude and Acoustic Richness.

Looking at the color coding - red indicates high values, yellow is mid-range, and dark blue shows lower values. For NP and AEI, higher values (redder colors) contribute to calmness, while for M and AR, lower values (bluer colors) make a scene feel more calm.

When we arrange the scenes by their overall calmness score, patterns emerge that align with narrative function. The calmest scenes at the top - like Nostalghia Scene16 and Scene05 - feature gentle dripping rain and distant reverberation. These precisely correspond to moments of ritual, memory, and threshold experiences.

In contrast, the scenes at the bottom from Solaris display denser water movements and correspond to narrative climaxes or emotional confrontations. This quantitative approach reveals how Tarkovsky's sonic strategies actively reinforce his signature contemplative narrative structure.

# Contributions & Implications

:: content ::

- Proposed framework: **sonic-ecological agency**  
- Bridges **film sound studies** and **ecoacoustics**  
- Demonstrates value of **computational methods** in ecocinema analysis  
- Future work: other water types, more computational descriptors
  
<!--
To conclude, I'm proposing a new framework I call 'sonic-ecological agency' that helps us understand how water sounds in film actively shape our ecological perception. 

What's valuable about this approach is how it bridges traditionally separate fields - film sound studies and ecoacoustics. By drawing on Jordan's audiovisual ecology theory and Ivakhiv's process-relational model, we can understand sound as an agent in world-making that works on affective and ecological levels, not just representational ones.

The computational methods I've demonstrated today with the rain scene analysis show how quantitative approaches can enrich ecocinema studies. Those ecoacoustic indices measuring calmness and naturalness reveal how Tarkovsky's sonic environments cultivate what we might call an 'attunement to place' - reinforcing Ivakhiv's argument that cinema fundamentally reshapes our perceptual ecologies.

Looking forward, I plan to extend this analysis to other water types from these films, like dripping and splashing, to build a more comprehensive understanding of acoustic textures and their narrative roles. I'm also interested in developing more refined computational descriptors and designing a perception study to better connect these sonic features with embodied and affective responses from viewers. This work opens up new possibilities for understanding how film sound shapes our relationship with the natural world.
