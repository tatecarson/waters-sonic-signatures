  abstract  = {Moving images take us on mental and emotional journeys, over the course of which we and our worlds undergo change. This is the premise of Ecologies of the Moving Image, which accounts for the ways cinematic moving images move viewers in ways that reshape our understanding of ourselves, of life, and of the Earth and universe. This book presents an ecophilosophy of the cinema: an account of the moving image in relation to its lived ecologies---the material, social, and perceptual relations within which movies are produced, consumed, and incorporated into cultural life. Cinema, Adrian Ivakhiv argues, lures us into its worlds, but those worlds are grounded in a material and communicative Earth that supports them, even if that supporting materiality withdraws from visibility. Ivakhiv examines the geographies, visualities, and anthropologies---relations of here and there, seer and seen, us and them, human and inhuman---found across a range of styles and genres, from ethnographic and wildlife documentaries to westerns and road movies, and from sci-fi blockbusters and eco-disaster films to the experimental and art films of Tarkovsky, Herzog, Greenaway, Malick, Dash, and Brakhage as well as YouTube's expanding audiovisual universe. Through its process-relational account of cinema, drawn from philosophers such as Whitehead, Peirce, and Deleuze, the book boldly enriches our understanding of film and visual media.},

  abstract = {This article examines the modernity crisis and the phenomenon of nostalgia in the works of the distinctive Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky's films Nostalghia (1983) and Mirror (1975). Within this perspective this study not only investigates the term, nostalgia, and its typology in the films, but also focuses on the socio-cultural and political refractions in the background that shape the director's use of the concept. Tarkovsky's cinema, particularly his last films, reflects the consequences of modernity crisis. In this regard his films Mirror and Nostalghia play an important role. This paper suggests that the film Nostalghia was made by the director in Italy in order to reveal this crisis in the case of a poet. The film, Nostalghia, removes the frontiers that developed in the Mirror, and puts the phenomenon nostalgia in the centre of the modernity crisis. To analyse the relationships between modernity crisis and Tarkovsky's films, this study grounds its analytic perspectives on the qualitative-descriptive method. In this regard, the study will start with the general characteristics of Tarkovsky's cinema and examine the typology of nostalgia, and then focus on his Nostalghia. After a detailed analysis of Nostalghia within this perspective, the article will compare it to another of his films, the controversial Mirror, to examine the changes in the master's life.},

  abstract   = {Discussion of cinematic affect most typically attends to response, the impact of the film as we experience it. In this vein, various writers have drawn attention to the physicality of hearing (Sobchack 2005; Cubitt 1998), while others have illuminated the ways in which sound communicates sensory information about the film world (Altman 1992; Chion 1994). However, attention to practice offers further opportunities to think about affect, that decisions made by sound practitioners take into account such considerations; sound practitioners frequently speak about their work in terms of feel, texture and experience. Moreover, the processes of creating film sound requires physical activity and involvement, play and experimentation, which might be literally physical, or have a kind of tactile analogy (to weaving, sculpting and so on). In this sense, affect is in the labour of making the film, as well as in our watching of it. Bringing together theory and practice therefore offers an opportunity to more fully develop an account of the particular contributions of sound to cinematic affect, and perhaps illuminate the significance of practitioners work to the sensory appeal of film more generally -- highlighting the creative effort of those filmmakers who traditionally receive less recognition for their achievements. Drawing on published and unpublished interviews with film sound personnel, this article will seek to show how a connection between theory and practice enables a deeper comprehension of filmic affect, traced through the embodied and empathetic qualities of sound work.},

This study, grounded in the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, examined the effects of natural soundscapes and pre-recorded whale vocalizations on inducing awe and influencing Pro-Environmental Intent (PEI) among whale watchers. Additionally, the study explored how increased whale knowledge impacts PEI. Findings reveal that awe significantly predicts heightened PEI, particularly in fostering connectedness with nature. Interestingly, no significant difference in awe levels emerged between participants exposed to natural soundscapes versus pre-recorded whale vocalizations. However, participants' whale knowledge substantially increased post-tour, contributing significantly to PEI. The influence of soundscapes on PEI was partially supported, with significant differences noted on the ``recycle and reuse'' subscale. Overall, the study highlights experiences of awe, the acquisition of knowledge, and exposure to natural soundscapes can collectively enhance environmental consciousness and strongly impact pro-environmental behaviours. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing tourism experiences that promote sustainable behaviour.},

  abstract = {Research about human perception of the acoustic environment is dominated by the use of sound pressure levels (SPL) or proprietary psychoacoustic indicators, limiting the link between sound and perception to only these two approaches. The aim of this study is to make connections between soundscape perception descriptors and ecoacoustic indices so that a perceptual dimension of ecoacoustic indices is ascertained. The study employs a laboratory experiment where 309 participants were exposed to sound and imagery from nine different urban land uses (n = 2,781) according to the soundscape protocol DIN ISO 12913-2. Spearman's correlation and ordinal logistic regression are used to analyze the relationship between continuous numeric ecoacoustic indices and Likert scale psychoacoustic perception outcomes. We find that the predictors median amplitude (M), acoustic richness (AR), number of peaks (NP), and acoustic evenness index (AEI) have significant correlations (r {$>$} 0.5: p {$\leq$} 0.05) and effect sizes ({$\beta$} {$\geq$} 0.1) for the psychoacoustic outcomes perceived affective quality (PAQ) of calm, pleasant, chaotic, annoying, and soundscape identifiers (SSI) traffic sounds and natural sounds. We find that between 59.4 \% and 81.9 \% of the variation within dependent SSI and PAQ variables is explained by ecoacoustic indices based on Nagelkerke's R-Squared values. High M and AR values are indicators for sound environments with high median or consistent amplitude, such as traffic noise, and high NP and AEI values are indicators for high fidelity sound environments with natural sounds or human beings that may be perceived as calm or pleasant. We conclude that combinations of M, AR, NP, and AEI as composite indicators contribute to understanding nine of the 14 psychoacoustic perception outcomes in DIN ISO 12913-2.},

In this study, we defined SP as a second-order factor and investigated its relationships with place attachment (PA) and tourists' ERB using structural equation modeling (SEM). Our aim was to identify how a soundscape could be improved to enhance the ERB of forest park tourists. Our results confirm the multidimensionality of SP, i.e., the three subdimensions of physical soundscape perception (PSP), psychological soundscape perception (SSP), and regional soundscape perception (RSP). Furthermore, our SEM results show that PA mediates the effect of the three subdimensions of SP on high-effort ERB (HERB). Our empirical results also reveal that the enhancement of tourists' SSP will foster their ERB. This study therefore extends the multisensory landscape literature by offering insights into the relationship between SP, PA, and tourists' ERB. Our findings provide empirical evidence for understanding the influence of SP on tourists' ERB in forest parks and demonstrate that PA should be considered an important context for soundscape design.},

We construct supervised neural network models with various pooling mechanisms to predict a film's genre from its soundtrack. We use these models to compare handcrafted music information retrieval (MIR) features against VGGish audio embedding features, finding similar performance with the top-performing architectures. We examine the best-performing MIR feature model through permutation feature importance (PFI), determining that mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and tonal features are most indicative of musical differences between genres. We investigate the interaction between musical and visual features with a cross-modal analysis, and do not find compelling evidence that music characteristic of a certain genre implies low-level visual features associated with that genre. Furthermore, we provide software code to replicate this study at https://github.com/usc-sail/mica-music-in-media. This work adds to our understanding of music's use in multi-modal contexts and offers the potential for future inquiry into human affective experiences.},

These environmental sounds are used to signify and enhance events occurring in film scenes. We propose a classification system for detecting the presence of violence and car chase scenes in film by classifying ten various environmental sounds that form the constituent audio events of these scenes using a number of old and new audio features. Experiments with our classification system on pure test sounds resulted in a correct event classification rate of 88.9\%. We also present the results of the classifier on the mixed audio tracks of several scenes taken from The Mummy and Lethal Weapon 2. The classification of sound events is the first step towards determining the presence of the complex sound scenes within film audio and describing the thematic content of the scenes.},

  abstract = {In line with the development of socio-ecological perspectives in conservation science, there is increasing interest in the role of soundscape perception in understanding human-environment interactions; the impact of natural soundscapes on human wellbeing is also increasingly recognized. However, research to date has focused on preferences and attitudes to western, urban locations. This study investigated individual emotional associations with local soundscape for three social groups living in areas with distinct degrees of urbanization, from pristine forest and pre-urban landscapes in Ecuador, to urban environments in UK and USA. Participants described sounds that they associated with a range of emotions, both positive and negative, which were categorized according to an adapted version of Schafer's sound classification scheme. Analyses included a description of the sound types occurring in each environment, an evaluation of the associations between sound types and emotions across social groups, and the elaboration of a soundscape perception map. Statistical analyses revealed that the distribution of sound types differed between groups, reflecting essential traits of each soundscape, and tracing the gradient of urbanization. However, some associations were universal: Natural Sounds were primarily associated with positive emotions, whereas Mechanical and Industrial Sounds were linked to negative emotions. Within nonurban environments, natural sounds were associated with a much wider range of emotions. Our analyses suggest that Natural Sounds could be considered as valuable natural resources that promotes human wellbeing. Special attention is required within these endangered forest locations, which should be classified as a ``threatened soundscapes,'' as well as ``threatened ecosystems,'' as we begin to understand the role of soundscape for the wellbeing of the local communities. The methodology presented in this article offers a fast, cheap tool for identifying reactions towards landscape modification and identifying sounds of social relevance. The potential contribution of soundscape perception within the current conservation approaches is discussed.},

I show that, even though               Sinister               is a narrative about a demon who lives in images, the horror in the soundtrack of this trailer is articulated through the sound design. I describe the structure of the soundtrack and analyse the distribution and organisation of dialogue, the use of different types of sound effects to create a connection between the viewer and the characters onscreen, as well as the use of specific localised sound events to organise attention and to frighten the viewer. I identify two features not previously discussed in relation to quantitative analysis of film soundtracks: an affective event based on reactions to a stimulus and the presence of nonlinear features in the sound envelopes of localised affective events. The sound design of this trailer is consistent with the principles of contemporary sound design in horror cinema, but also demonstrates some variation in its use of sound as a paratext to its parent film.},

  abstract   = {The subject of my paper is to examine nostalgia as ``involuntary memory'' in Andrei Tarkovsky's movie Nostalghia. Tarkovsky understands filming as ``sculpting in time.'' In his book with the same title he writes that ``time and memory merge into each other.'' In order to understand this we have to distinguish between a voluntary memory, which refers to the intentional effort to remember, and the involuntary memory, which is like a force that comes over us, that affects us. The latter is especially the case with nostalgia. In nostalgia we can find a revision of the past but the revised version of the past is not primarily about the production of a new representation of memory but more a case of re-experiencing the same past through returning to it, particularly in an embodied manner. Nostalgia is a particular mode of ``memory of place.'' Places we inhabit or pass through leave an impact on us, for we are bodily subjects and as such we have a relationship with the places that surround us. What Tarkovsky's movie Nostalghia shows is how the spatio-temporality of the present is ``haunted'' by the superimposed appearance of the past. Nostalgia is a movement of seeping returns. The past transpires in the present, and Tarkovsky makes this structure visible in using the visual medium of film. He shows how the texture of the everyday world fuses with the imagined memory of the past. In my paper, I construe this nostalgic experience provided by Tarkovsky.},

Whereas in his early features the director used to employ a regular music track composed by Viacheslav Ovchinnikov, in his later films made in in the 1970s he worked together with composer Eduard Artemiev who created original and highly experimental soundtracks. As the chapter demonstrates, Tarkovsky primarily strived for the realistic sound aesthetic, requesting a variety of noises and natural sounds, in conjunction with electronic arrangement. At the same time his sonic realism progressively tends towards irrealism in his later films when selected natural sounds manifest their otherworldly dimension. His preference for natural sounds sounding unnaturally is especially evident in his last film The Sacrifice (1986), when Tarkovsky decided to work with the sound mixer only, Owe Svensson, without a composer.},

To explore these trends, we created a transdisciplinary, narrative-led podcast series produced by the BBC, called Forest 404. The series explored the implications of a world without nature. An online experimental component mobilized audience participation (n~=~7,596) to assess responses to natural soundscapes with and without abiotic, biotic, and poetic elements across five biomes. Conditions featuring the sounds of wildlife, such as bird song, were perceived to be more psychologically restorative than those without. Participants' personal lived experiences were strongly related to these outcomes; those who had memories triggered by the sounds were more likely to find them psychologically restorative and exhibited a greater motivation to preserve them. Moreover, the effects of both soundscape composition and memories on preservation behavior were partially mediated by restorative potential; respondents were more likely to want to protect the sounds they heard if they thought they might offer therapeutic outcomes. Our findings highlight the value of art-science collaborations and demonstrate how maintaining contact with the natural world can promote wellbeing and foster behaviors that protect planetary health.},

This involves a review of the phenomena that have developed so far as well as a philosophical consideration of the sources, consequences, and potential limitations of quantitative thinking in an area traditionally occupied by the humanities. Quantitative methods are not considered here as a replacement for existing paradigms, but rather as their complement, extension, and often inspiration. This allows to understand the current transformations but also integrate them with traditional research approaches, and identify the pitfalls and difficulties associated with this paradigm shift.},

Throughout several audio and audio-video tests we have compared both Foley and real sounds originated by an identical action. The main purpose was to evaluate if sound effects are always better than real sounds [1]. We found a similarity in subjects preferences between real sounds and Foley sounds, with a limited discrimination ability between them.},

  abstract   = {Listening to Noise and Silence engages with the emerging practice of sound art and the concurrent development of a discourse and theory of sound. In this original and challenging work, Salom{\'e} Voegelin immerses the reader in concepts of listening to sound artwork and the everyday acoustic environment, establishing an aesthetics and philosophy of sound and promoting the notion of a sonic sensibility.             A multitude of sound works are discussed, by lesser known contemporary artists and composers (for example Curgenven, Gasson and Federer), historical figures in the field (Artaud, Feldman and Cage), and that of contemporary canonic artists such as Janet Cardiff, Bill Fontana, Bernard Parmegiani, and Merzbow.             Informed by the ideas of Adorno, Merleau-Ponty and others, the book aims to come to a critique of sound art from its soundings rather than in relation to abstracted themes and pre-existing categories. Listening to Noise and Silence broadens the discussion surrounding sound art and opens up the field for others to follow.},

  abstract  = {We study the problem of affective content analysis. In this paper, we think of affective contents as those video/audio segments, which may cause an audience's strong reactions or special emotional experiences, such as laughing or fear. Those emotional factors are related to the users' attention, evaluation, and memories of the content. The modeling of affective effects depends on the video genres. In this work, we focus on comedy and horror films to extract the affective content by detecting a set of so-called audio emotional events (AEE) such as laughing, horror sounds, etc. Those AEE can be modeled by various audio processing techniques, and they can directly reflect an audience's emotion. We use the AEE as a clue to locate corresponding video segments. Domain knowledge is more or less employed at this stage. Our experimental dataset consists of 40-minutes comedy video and 40-minutes horror film. An average recall and precision of above 90\% is achieved. It is shown that, in addition to rich visual information, an appropriate usage of special audios is an effective way to assist affective content analysis.},
